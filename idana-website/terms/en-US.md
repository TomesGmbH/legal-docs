Date: 2018-04-04

### Contracting partner

The contractual partners are Tomes GmbH, Engesserstr. 4a, 79108 Freiburg i. Br. and the customer, who is an entrepreneur within the meaning of §14 BGB (German Civil Code).

### Subject of the Contract

These terms and conditions apply to the use of the software Idana of Tomes GmbH as Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) according to the current product description. The software is provided by the provider for download and uses server and system components provided by Tomes GmbH as SaaS.

The customer is enabled to use the software stored and running on the servers of the provider or a service provider commissioned by the provider via an Internet connection during the term of this contract for his own purposes and to store and process his data with their help.

### Conclusion of the Contract

The contract comes into effect with the use of the Idana software.

### Usage Requirements

To use Idana, the customer must perform the following activities:

Download and install the application for doctors and employees (“desktop app”, which can be downloaded from the homepage idana.one, on a PC running Windows 7 or later or on a Mac running Mac OS X 10.9 or later.

Obtain and install the application for patients (“Mobile App”) on an Android tablet with version 5.0 or later via the Google Play Store. Alternatively, patients can install the app on their personal devices. Devices for which the operating system has been changed (Rooting) are not supported.

Register a user account in the desktop app and log in to the desktop app. Authentication takes place via a user ID (e-mail) and a password (“login password”) via the service provider Auth0 Inc. The password can be changed at any time by the customer by using the “Forgot password” function.

Perform the registration process that starts with the first login to the desktop app. The customer data is recorded and a key pair consisting of a private and public key desktop app is generated. The private key is encrypted with a password (“PIN”) specified by the customer and is never transmitted in unencrypted form at any time. The private key is stored offline by the customer as a recovery key in order to recover the data in case of password loss.

### Services of Tomes GmbH

Idana enables the customer to communicate with patients in writing and to document their medical history, i.e. symptoms, medical history and relevant background information.

Tomes GmbH provides the customer with the Idana software via internet. Idana consists of the desktop app for doctors and employees and a mobile app for Android.

Tomes GmbH operates the server and system components necessary for the operation of Idana and provides these to the customer as SaaS for the duration of the contract. The components are operated in a technically and organizationally secured, high-performance data center certified according to ISO 27001.

The communication of the software installed by the customer and the server provided by Tomes GmbH takes place exclusively via encrypted connections via HTTPS. All data is stored encrypted in the data center.

Patient data is encrypted with the user’s public key before being transferred in the mobile app and only decrypted locally in the desktop app again by the user. No unencrypted patient data is transmitted over the Internet. Neither Tomes GmbH nor the operators of the data centers can view patient data.

Tomes GmbH does not process personal data for the customer. All patient data is processed locally in the apps provided according to the actions carried out by the customer.

### Purpose of Use

The information provided by Idana may not be interpreted or used as a substitute for medical advice and therapy. The application is not intended to replace or provide a basis for medical diagnoses and/or treatments. The application is not a medical device according to its intended purpose. The provider accepts no liability for consequences resulting from the user or third parties using the data and information entered or generated.

### Customer’s rights

Tomes GmbH grants the customer the non-exclusive, non-transferable, time-limited right to use the Idana software on one or more end devices. The software may neither be modified – except to the necessary extent in the context of a correction of errors or the intended use – nor back-developed, further developed or translated. Partial duplication of the written material for internal purposes is permitted insofar as this is necessary for the intended use of the software.

### Customer’s Obligations

When ordering the license, the customer is obliged to provide true information about the circumstances of use, in particular about the type of facility (e.g. individual or group practice or clinic department) and the number of doctors working in the facility.

The customer is obliged not to disclose his user name, login password, PIN, key or recovery key to third parties in order to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

The customer is obliged to immediately notify Idana of the assertion of alleged rights by third parties as well as defects or damages.

### Software Updates

Tomes GmbH offers software updates at irregular intervals. The customer is automatically informed when the desktop app is updated when the Internet connection is available. The mobile app is updated via the Google Play Store, which must be configured by the customer for automatic updates.

Downloading the software update is a mandatory prerequisite for ensuring that the customer can use the latest version of the software and make use of the latest functionalities. The Tomes GmbH points out that the functionality is not or only limited usable, if the installation of the update is omitted. In this case, Tomes GmbH is released from any liability if it proves that the defect would not have occurred when installing the latest software version.

### Beta versions

The Tomes GmbH does not grant any guarantees or support for program versions, which are marked as beta. This can be seen, for example, in the file name of the installation or the label in the App Store. These program versions are for test and development purposes and are not designed for productive operation. For this reason, data loss or incompatibility with other program versions is also possible. Every beta tester should take care to export received reports directly.

### Use by third parties / Non-contractual use of software

The customer may neither sell the software Idana beyond the scope of this contract nor transfer it to others for a limited period of time, in particular not rent or lend it.

### Free Trial

Each customer is entitled to activate the free trial period once, which provides full access to Idana’s features for 14 days according to the service description. After the trial period, the account is automatically terminated as long as no chargeable license is purchased.

### Paid License

The customer may order a paid license at any time to use Idana indefinitely after the trial period has expired. The conditions listed in the order apply. The order is possible within the desktop app.

### Starter Kit

The customer can order a starter set which contains suitable hardware for the use of Idana by patients. The conditions including payment options and delivery times can be found in the current service description.

The order represents an offer to conclude a sales contract. The customer receives a message confirming receipt of the order and listing its details. The sales contract is concluded with the dispatch of the goods, for which the customer receives a separate dispatch confirmation. If the contract of sale is not concluded, amounts already paid will be refunded.

Unless otherwise agreed, delivery will be made to the delivery address specified by the customer. All information on availability, shipping or delivery of a product are only expected information and approximate guide values.

If the goods cannot be delivered and the customer is responsible for this, e.g. by stating an incorrect delivery address or absence at the announced delivery time, the customer shall bear the costs for the unsuccessful delivery.

For deliveries outside the EU, the customer shall bear any import duties and taxes that may be incurred.

The customer can return the ordered hardware within 14 days after complete receipt of the goods without giving reasons (“money-back guarantee”). The purchase price will be refunded to the customer by bank transfer to the specified bank account. The customer bears the costs for the return. The money back guarantee is only valid if the hardware is fully functional, visually in perfect condition, without traces of use and incl. packaging and accessories.

### Terms of Payment

The fees incurred in each month will be invoiced at the beginning of the following month. Invoices are sent by e-mail to the specified invoice address of the customer.

Each invoice will be sent by e-mail to the registered billing address of the customer and must be paid within fourteen days after receipt by bank transfer or by alternative payment methods listed in the invoice.

If the Customer issues a SEPA Direct Debit Mandate, amounts will be collected on the next but one bank working day after the invoice is issued.

### Cancellation

The contract may be terminated at any time upon purchase of a paid license. The outstanding amount is then invoiced immediately and the entry of new surveys is deactivated.

In the event of termination, data already collected can be viewed for a further six months using Idana’s desktop app. After six months, all customer data, including stored patient data, will be deleted. The customer is given the option of exporting the patient data in order to meet the legal retention periods.

### Changes to the General Terms and Conditions (GTC), Service Descriptions and Prices

These GTC may be amended insofar as this does not affect essential provisions of the contractual relationship and this is necessary for adaptation to developments which could not have been foreseen at the time the contract was concluded and whose failure to take account would noticeably disturb the balance of the contractual relationship. Essential regulations are in particular those concerning the type and scope of the contractually agreed services and the term including the regulations on termination. Furthermore, adjustments or additions to the GTC may be made insofar as this is necessary to eliminate difficulties in the execution of the contract due to loopholes arising after conclusion of the contract. This may be the case in particular if the case law changes and clauses of these GTC are affected by it.

### Delay

In case of delay in payment in a not insignificant amount, Tomes GmbH is entitled to block the use of the service at the customer’s expense. The assertion of further claims due to default of payment remains reserved to Tomes GmbH.

### Rights in Case of Defects

Tomes GmbH guarantees the contractual quality of the Idana software within the framework of the legal provisions.

### Liability

In the event of intent or gross negligence and in the absence of a guaranteed property, Tomes GmbH shall be liable without limitation for all damage resulting therefrom. In case of negligence Tomes is liable without limitation in case of injury to life, body and health. In all other respects, liability is excluded, whereby liability under the Product Liability Act remains unaffected.
