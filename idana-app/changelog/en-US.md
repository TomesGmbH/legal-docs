## Idana v3.0 released

### The Idana Check-In - digital patient admission redefined
Idana Check-In now offers practices and clinics the possibility of generating codes and corresponding links through which patients themselves can request an e-mail survey with pre-defined questionnaires. The codes can, for example, be given over the telephone and entered on idana.app. The links can, for example, be stored on the patient's own website or in the online appointment planning system.

Here one of our customers describes how he was able to effectively integrate check-in with his online appointment scheduling system: [To the article](https://idana.com/anwender-video-integration-von-idana-in-die-praxissoftware-tomedo-und-der-nutzen-im-umgang-mit-der-corona-pandemie/) (German)

### Support of intelligent natural language text generation for documentation and doctor's letter

In the GDT settings it is now possible to define under which path and name the PDF files are stored during GDT export and in which form the text report is transferred. This enables the support of further practice systems.
