## Idana 2.7 released

### Support of intelligent natural language text generation for documentation and doctor's letter
Using the Idana questionnaire editor, a continuous text template can now be created for each questionnaire. This allows a natural language text to be generated from the patient answers, which can be used for documentation and further use in the doctor's letter.

In the GDT settings it is now possible to define under which path and name the PDF files are stored during GDT export and in which form the text report is transferred. This enables the support of further practice systems.
