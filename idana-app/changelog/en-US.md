### Your personal welcome screen
You can now enter your own text and an image or logo in the settings, which will be displayed to your patients at the beginning of the questionnaire.

### Improved patient app
With the feedback from our customers, we have further optimized the user-friendliness for patients. The scroll navigation mode is automatically used on smartphones and PCs, the pure button navigation is only activated on tablets for older patients.

## Idana 2.2 released
Idana goes international with our December update. We fixed some bugs and released the English translation which includes almost all questionnaires.

## Idana 2.1 released
The November update adds many new features to Idana. The highlights:

### 30 new questionnaires
These included new symptom-related questionnaires for general medicine, further diagnostic questionnaires for psychiatry and the questionnaires of the German Pain Society. The new section *Chemotherapy* facilitates therapy monitoring and side effect management.

### Bi-directional GDT interface
Idana now offers a fully integrated workflow with practice management systems that support GDT. The master data is automatically imported and the PDF report is stored directly in the patient file. The interface can be configured under *Settings*.

### Scroll mode for patients
The patient app now offers a choice between navigation via *Previous/Next* buttons or scrolling with the finger or mouse wheel. The scroll mode allows a faster filling, the button navigation avoids accidental skipping of questions.
