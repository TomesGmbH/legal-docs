## Idana 2.1 released

The November update adds many new features to Idana. The highlights:

### 30 new questionnaires

These included new symptom-related questionnaires for general medicine, further diagnostic questionnaires for psychiatry and the questionnaires of the German Pain Society. The new section *Chemotherapy* facilitates therapy monitoring and side effect management.

### Bi-directional GDT interface

Idana now offers a fully integrated workflow with practice management systems that support GDT. The master data is automatically imported and the PDF report is stored directly in the patient file. The interface can be configured under *Settings*.

### Scroll mode for patients

The patient app now offers a choice between navigation via *Previous/Next* buttons or scrolling with the finger or mouse wheel. The scroll mode allows a faster filling, the button navigation avoids accidental skipping of questions.
