## Idana 2.4 released

### Automatic report export to a folder

Idana can now automatically save new reports in a folder, both as PDF and structured in JSON format. You can also find these new options in the settings.

### Remember PIN for auto-login

For your convenience, Idana now offers the option of storing the PIN for data decryption locally. With this feature, you no longer have to enter the PIN every time you start Idana.
