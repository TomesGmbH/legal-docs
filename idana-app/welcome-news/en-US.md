## Idana v3.1 released

### Idana now stores the biometric signature in PDF reports 
Idana captures an electronic signature at the end of each survey, depending on the hardware also with biometric identification features (a so-called "biometric signature"). In this way, the voluntary electronic form is fulfilled, which is sufficient for many applications in practice.

In our blog you will find a series of articles about legally compliant signing of practice forms with Idana: [Open the series of articles](https://idana.com/beitragsreihe-arztrecht-praxisformulare-rechtssicher-mit-idana-unterschreiben-lassen/)

### Idana now shows your practice address in the reports
Idana now shows your practice name, address and optionally the website in the reports. Please add this information under ***My Account -> Practice Stamp & Privacy*** so that your reports contain the correct information.

### Highly optimized email template
The email template for sending survey emails from Idana has been greatly optimized for more reliable delivery and response to surveys. Please note the following points:
* The new central e-mail template already contains a greeting in the name of your practice/institution.
* The note is no longer displayed at the beginning of the e-mail, but after the button "Fill in online forms".
* We recommend that you remove salutations and greeting formulas from your mail templates so that the composed e-mail appears natural.
